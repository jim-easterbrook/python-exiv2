  3/ Enable video support in binary wheels.

Changes in v0.13.0:
  1/ Automatically cast Exiv2::Value return values to correct type.
  2/ Exiv2::byte* return values are converted to a simple buffer object.
  3/ Deprecated some superseded features. Use 'python -Wd' when testing.
  4/ Exiv2's Date & Time structs can be used from Python.
  5/ Removed Value.downCast methods deprecated in v0.7.0.
  6/ Reduced probability of segfaults by keeping references to other objects.

Changes in v0.12.1:
  1/ Fix iterator bug introduced in v0.10.0. (Issue #7.)

Changes in v0.12.0:
  1/ Enable passing Python buffer to Exiv2::DataValue constructor.
  2/ Enable passing Python buffer to Exiv2::Value copy() methods.

Changes in v0.11.3:
  1/ Fix localisation initialisation problem on MacOS.

Changes in v0.11.2:
  1/ Prevent PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN warning / error in Python 3.8 and above.

  1/ Improved initialisation of localisation.

Changes in v0.11.0:
  1/ Changed PyPI package name from python-exiv2 to exiv2.
  2/ Simplified some data iterators and function return values.

Changes in v0.10.0:
  1/ API change: replaced Value += operator with append method.
  2/ Improved conversion of LangAltValue to/from Python dict.
  3/ Can construct some other values from a Python list.
  4/ AnyError exception renamed to Exiv2Error (with AnyError wrapper for
     compatibility).
  5/ Enabled localisation of error messages etc.
  6/ Python enum class is used for Exiv2 enums.

Changes in v0.9.0:
  1/ Add Exiv2::BasicIo and its subclasses to Python interface.

Changes in v0.8.3:
  1/ Xmp LangAlt values can be accessed like a Python dict.
  2/ Binary wheels are built with BMFF file support enabled.

Changes in v0.8.2:
  1/ No longer detect possible iterator invalidation (unreliable).
  2/ Restructured macros to give slightly less bloated code.

Changes in v0.8.1:
  1/ Fix some causes of segfaults.
  2/ Slightly change output of Metadatum.__str__().

Changes in v0.8.0:
  1/ Data iterators include checks for end of data and changed data so are less
     likely to segfault.

  1/ Fix undefined symbol problem with Linux binary wheels.
  2/ XmpProperties.registeredNamespaces() returns a Python dict.

Changes in v0.5.0:
