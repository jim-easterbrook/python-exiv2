Changes in v0.8.1:
  1/ Fix some causes of segfaults.
  2/ Slightly change output of Metadatum.__str__().

Changes in v0.8.0:
  1/ Data iterators include checks for end of data and changed data so are less
     likely to segfault.
  2/ Added indexing to data values to access fundamental types such as int.
  3/ API change: removed access to value_ container in data values.

Changes in v0.7.0:
  1/ Add a constructor to Value subclasses that downcasts a Value.
  2/ Deprecated the Value subclass downCast() static method.
  3/ Include enableBMFF function when libexiv2 version >= 0.27.4.

Changes in v0.6.0:
  1/ Add Exiv2::PreviewManager to Python interface.

Changes in v0.5.1:
  1/ Fix undefined symbol problem with Linux binary wheels.
  2/ XmpProperties.registeredNamespaces() returns a Python dict.

Changes in v0.5.0:

  1/ "Easy Access" functions have been added to the interface.
