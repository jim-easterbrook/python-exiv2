Examples
========

These example files are based on the `C++ examples`_ provided by the Exiv2 project.
They are mostly not very "Pythonic", but they do show how to do things with python-exiv2.
Some really low level stuff that you can do in C++ (downcasting pointers, for example) just can't be done in Python, so those bits have been left out.
